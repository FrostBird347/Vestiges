Upon death, you will leave a temporary remnant for other players to find.

[h1]WARNING:[/h1]

Upon death, your current room and region will be accessible via a [b]public[/b] spreadsheet. Do not use this mod if you are working on a custom region mod and don't wish to leak any info!

So, what exactly does this mod do?

Well upon death or being grabbed by a lizard, a [strike]modified firefly[/strike] Vestige is created at your current location and through a very advanced system called uh... Google Forms and Google Slides, your new Vestige will be uploaded and accessible to everyone else (when they next restart the game) for a month.

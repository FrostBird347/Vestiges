[h1]WARNING:[/h1]

Upon death, your current room and region will be accessible via a [b]public[/b] spreadsheet. Do not use this mod if you are working on a custom region mod and don't wish to leak any info!

So, what exactly does this mod do?

Well upon death or being grabbed by a lizard, a [strike]modified firefly[/strike] Vestige is created at your current location and through a very advanced system called uh... Google Forms and Google Sheets, your new Vestige will be uploaded and then become accessible to everyone else (within half an hour) for up to a month!

I got the idea of [strike]ab[/strike]using Google Forms and Sheets a year ago from a small game called [url=https://ash-k.itch.io/radiobubble/devlog/343058/radio-bubbles-postmortem]Radio Bubbles[/url].

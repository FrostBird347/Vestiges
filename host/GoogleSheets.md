# Google Sheets

Must be linked to [Google Forms](./GoogleForms.md) if you are planning on uploading new Vestiges.

It must also have the permissions: `Anyone on the internet with the link can view`.

I strongly recommend setting the timezone to GMT+00:00 before you add any entries as the client treats these dates as UCT dates.

If you are also using the [Google Script](./VestigeClear.gs), I would also recommend setting it's timezone to match.

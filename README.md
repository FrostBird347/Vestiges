Upon death, you will leave a temporary remnant for other players to find.

## WARNING:

Upon death, your current room and region will be accessable via a **public** spreadsheet. Do not use this mod if you are working on a custom region mod and don't wish to leak any info!

So, what exactly does this mod do?

Well upon death or being grabbed by a lizard, a ~~modified firefly~~ Vestige is created at your current location and through a very advanced system called uh... Google Forms and Google Slides, your new Vestige will be uploaded and accessable to everyone else (when they next restart the game) for a month.
